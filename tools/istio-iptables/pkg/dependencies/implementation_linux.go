			// In both cases we are setting the lockfile to `r.NetworkNamespace`.
			// * /dev/null looks like a good option, but actually doesn't work (it will ensure only one actor can access it)
			// * `mktemp` works, but it is slightly harder to deal with cleanup and in some platforms we may not have write access.
			//
			// In some setups, iptables can make remote network calls(!!). Since these come from a partially initialized pod network namespace,
			// these calls can be blocked (or NetworkPolicy, etc could block them anyways).
			// This is triggered by NSS, which allows various things to use arbitrary code to lookup configuration that typically comes from files.
			// In our case, the culprit is the `xt_owner` (`-m owner`) module in iptables calls the `passwd` service to lookup the user.
			// To disallow this, bindmount /dev/null over nsswitch.conf so this never happens.
			// This should be safe to do, even if the user has an nsswitch entry that would work fine: we always use a numeric ID
			// so the passwd lookup doesn't need to succeed at all for Istio to function.
			// Effectively, we want a mini-container. In fact, running in a real container would be ideal but it is hard to do portably.
